title:  Product Variety, Licensing and Vertical Integration in Two-Sided Market (JMP)
summary: The paper evaluates vertical integration in two-sided markets. Vertical Integration may have anti-competitive effects such as foreclosure, or may have pro-competitive effects:efficient pricing. In the two-sided market, vertical integration helps solve the "chicken and egg" dilemma (Rysman, 2009) through the cross-network effects:expand variety and grow consumer base. I showed theoretically that the impact of vertical integration on consumer welfare highly depends on the consumer installed base which affects the cross-network effects.  I develop a model of platform's optimal pricing, third-party firms' entry and pricing, consumer adoption and purchasing, and estimates using data on the single-serve coffee industry. Counterfactual simulations show vertical integration decreases consumer welfare by 2.2% where the gain from price efficiency is lower than the loss due to market power. However, this welfare loss is offset by the gain in the increased entry of third-party firms. Also, the platform would reduce the licensing fee by 3% after vertical integration due to a stronger incentive to attract new consumers and this would lead to welfare gains in 9% of the markets while it's not likely in the one-sided markets.
