title: "Competition & Price Dispersion: Lessons from the Northeast Alliance"
summary: 	"This paper explores the effects of the Northeast Alliance (NEA) between American Airlines and JetBlue Airways on airfares. The NEA led to a 3.9% reduction in airfares at LaGuardia Airport, demonstrating the relationship between competition and pricing in alliance markets. While JetBlue's entry into these markets did not lower overall airfares, it reduced prices for lower-end products in markets where JetBlue already operated. Our findings suggest that reduced competition allows firms to more effectively price discriminate."
